# burger

## Description 

This project is a simple app to record burgers you've eaten. This app uses Sequelize as the ORM to perform Get, Post, and Update queries in MySQL based on the MVC paradigm. The functionalities in this app can be used in many applications that use CRUD for database queries.

Use this code as a template for MySQL database queries, connecting MySQL to Node.js, or use this project to learn how to use the NPM package "Inquirer".

## Installation

To install the project files, you can clone the "burger" repository which contains the necessary files at https://github.com/jgarcia60/burger by clicking the green drop down "Code" and cloning the repo with an SSH key. To run the command line interface app, you will need to run "node server.js" in the correct directory in your terminal. However, the "schema.sql" file should be run in your MySQL GUI first to create the database before connecting it in Node.js. 


## Usage 

You may use this code to learn about how to use the Sequelize ORM for MySQL, or as a tool to learn about using node.js, utilizing "CRUD" queries in MySQL, and more! Check out the link below for the deployed application:
